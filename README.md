# Loading Strategies for Web Fonts -  Demo
## Demo supplement for my Degree project in Computer Science (2DV50E)

### About
This repository is a supplement to my degree project in Computer Science. It's primary purpose is to demonstrate how resource prioritization approaches like Preload and HTTP/2 Push can be used to optimize the delivery of web fonts for first-time visitors.

The selected strategies builds upon a font loading strategy called Critical Flash Of Faux Text, that Zach Leatherman writes about in his article [A COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO FONT LOADING STRATEGIES] 


## Abstract - Thesis
According to the HTTP Archive, 75% of websites are using web fonts. Multiple
conditions have to be met before modern web browsers like Chrome, Firefox
and Safari decide to download the web fonts needed on a page. As a result, web
fonts are late discovered resources that can delay the First Meaningful Paint
(FMP). Improving the FMP is relevant for the web industry, particularly for
performance-conscious web developers. This paper gives insight into how the
resource prioritization approaches HTTP/2 Preload and HTTP/2 Server Push can
be used to optimize the delivery of web fonts for first-time visitors. Five font
loading strategies that use HTTP/2 Server Push and/or Preload were implemented
on replicas of the landing pages from five real-world websites. The font loading
strategies were evaluated against each other, and against the non-optimized
version of each landing page. All the evaluated font loading strategies in this
degree project improved the time it took to deliver the first web font content to
the userâ€™s screen, resulting in a faster FMP. It was also discovered that HTTP/2
Server Push, on its own, is not a more performance efficient resource prioritization
approach than HTTP/2 Preload when it comes to delivering web font content to
the client. Further, HTTP/2 Server Push and HTTP/2 Preload appears to be more
efficient when used together, in the context of optimizing the delivery of web font
content. However, all conclusions in this paper are based on the results gathered
from testing the font loading strategies in an emulated environment and are yet to
be confirmed on actual mobile devices with real network conditions.

## Instructions

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (10.5.0 or later)

1. Clone this repository
   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/mia-nygren/2DV50E-loading-strategies-for-web-fonts-demo.git 
   ```

1. Navigate to the project folder
   ```sh
   $ cd loading-strategies-for-web-fonts-demo
   ```

1. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   $ npm install
   ```

1. Run the demo in development mode
   ```sh
   $ npm run dev
   ```

1. Open <http://localhost:8000> to view the demo  
    *You can change the port in server/config/index.js*

## USAGE -  Example

Once in Chrome, open Chrome Devtools Inspector (right click ...)  
Go to the networks tab and see which resources that was pushed 

Make a Network trace with screenshots to see how the web fonts are loading and being replaced. 

- enable screenshots 

## Limitations
This code example does not contain any optimization approaches for repeat views, since this was outside of the 
scope of this project, due to time limitations. 

Only .woff2 files were used for testing the resource prioritization approaches in this degree project. In production it is recommended to include at least the .woff format (for browsers that do not support .woff2).
